wxDatabase is built on the excellent work of Joseph Blough called DatabaseLayer.  You can read its story on history file.
BUILDING
To build wxDatabase, you need to have the database ou want to connect ready with headers and library. I will explain using MySQL but the process is the same with any other database.

MYSQL
1. [Download](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/c/) MySQL Connector C and Install it. In Linux you just need to install development library of MySQL
2. Open your Console (CMD for windows fo example) and cd to build sub-folder in wxDatabase root directory
3. Run CMake command to generate your flavour (e.g. cmake Verbose=1 -G "MinGW Makefiles" ../)
4. run make program (for MinGW files use mingw32-make)
5. Enjoy your libraries in build folder)
